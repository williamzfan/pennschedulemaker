# Penn Schedule Maker
An automatic course schedule maker for students at the University of Pennsylvania. For any given major, course requirements and prerequisites are webscraped and a schedule is created. Algorithms are implemented to insure courses are well balanced throughout the semesters (i.e. a good balance of STEM, humanities, language, etc. classes).
